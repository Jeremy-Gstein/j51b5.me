<p>Hello, I am known online by the alias Shodo or IRL as Jeremy. I'm a Cyber Security Student looking to share the information that fascinates me with the world. I started attending university in Summer of 2020 which was an interesting time to decide to go back to school because of the pandemic. From a young age I have always been interested in technology and networks, quickly becoming a novice trouble shooter for friends and family members. As I progressed my understanding of basic troubleshooting, that turned into jailbreaking friendâ€™s devices and doing who knows what with Low-Orbit-Ion-Cannon. After obtaining my first job I finally had saved enough money for my first computer build which is where the story gets put on pause due to binging World of Warcraft throughout my teens. Nowadays most of my time is spent exploring and learning about the different sectors of Cyber Security as they all truly grab my attention. I hope to one day be able to put my focus into one specific field and be able to express my excitement and passion for this industry.</p>
